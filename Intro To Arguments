# DOJO (Linux Luminarium)
## MODULE(Hello Hackers):
### CHALLENGE(Intro To Arguments):
### WHAT I LEARNT :
**echo**: a command which  is used to display a line of text or can be assumed as print function from python (my understanding)
**Argument**:additional data passed to the command. When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments. basically the text near commands which gives additional information (my understanding)
